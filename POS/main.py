#POS Software
'''This POS Software is built to make withdrawing more easier.

First feature --- Location of the major POS centres to know the closest POS shop
closest to you.

Second feature --- This is scary actually but I want to make it in such a way that we can
order it to your house but I don't think I'll move forward with this because of security
reasons

#POS means POINT-OF-SALE

I'm actually building this software to practice  4 major concepts
1. Decorators
2. Enumerate
3. Lambdas
